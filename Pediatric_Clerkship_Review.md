# **COMPREHENSIVE PEDIATRIC CLERKSHIP REVIEW**
## **For Pediatric Clerkship Students at Inova Hospital**
### **Developed by Dr. Shiksha Sharma, MD**
### **Pediatric Hospitalist, 1st Year Post-Fellowship**
---

## **INTRODUCTION: PHILOSOPHY OF THIS CURRICULUM**

Dr. Shiksha Sharma is now in her **first year as a pediatric hospitalist** at Inova Hospital—the perfect position to translate her fresh GI fellowship training and evolving hospitalist experience into **clear, clinically-grounded teaching for medical students.**

This curriculum restructures foundational pediatric content (based on Emma Holliday's high-yield framework) through a **hospitalist's lens:**

- **What matters in the hospital:** Acute presentation, escalation triggers, inpatient management
- **What students must know before discharge rounds:** Assessment, workup, next steps
- **What prevents harm:** Red flags, can't-miss diagnoses, when to escalate to specialist
- **Real workflow:** How pediatric hospitalists actually think and act

---

## **CURRICULUM OVERVIEW: 4-WEEK CLERKSHIP STRUCTURE**

This is designed as a **comprehensive review guide** that medical students rotate through during their 4-week pediatric inpatient rotation.

### **Timeline:**
- **Week 1:** Acute Presentations & Emergencies (How to think urgently)
- **Week 2:** System-Based Approach (GI, Respiratory, Cardiac, Renal focus)
- **Week 3:** Chronic/Complex Pediatric Problems (Management continuity)
- **Week 4:** Synthesis, Quality Improvement & Senior Presentations

---

# **WEEK 1: ACUTE PEDIATRIC PRESENTATIONS & EMERGENCIES**
## **"The Things That Will Page You at 3 AM"**

### **Guiding Principle:**
Medical students arrive asking: "What's sick? What's not? What do I do *right now*?" Week 1 answers this through **clinical decision-making under urgency.**

---

## **Session 1.1: The Critically Ill Neonate (Day 1-28) — 90 minutes**

### **Learning Objectives:**
By end of session, students can:
- Recognize **septic neonates** vs. benign presentations
- Order appropriate workup for fever in <28 day old
- Identify **can't-miss emergencies** (meningitis, sepsis, congenital heart disease, metabolic crisis)
- Know **escalation pathway** (when to call NICU? When to transfer?)

### **Clinical Vignette Opening:**

> "Day 3 neonate, temp 38.5°C, irritable, not feeding well. Parents asking: 'Is this normal? We were told babies get fevers...' **What do you do in the first hour?**"

**Answer Framework (Teach This Explicitly):**
```
NEONATE <28 DAYS WITH FEVER (≥38°C rectal)
    ↓
    THIS IS AN EMERGENCY until proven otherwise
    ↓
    Immediate Actions (STAT):
    ├─ Airway/Breathing/Circulation assessment
    ├─ IV access × 2 (anticipate need for fluids/antibiotics)
    ├─ STAT Labs: CBC, CMP, blood culture, urinalysis + urine culture, CSF (LP), CXR
    ├─ Empiric antibiotics within 1 hour: Ampicillin + gentamicin ± ceftaxime (if meningitis risk high)
    └─ Admit to hospital (minimum observation/testing; likely NICU-level care)
    
    Why ampicillin? → Covers Listeria (unique to neonates <3 months); cephalosporins don't
    Why LP mandatory? → Meningitis mortality ↑ if antibiotics given before LP
```

### **Key Teaching Points (From Dr. Sharma's Experience):**

**Red Flags in Neonates:**
- **Temperature:** Any fever in <28 days = workup (don't assume teething; neonates don't teethe)
- **Feeding:** Refusal to feed often earliest sign of sepsis
- **Lethargy:** Should be sleeping, but arousable; true lethargy = red flag
- **Jaundice:** If progressing rapidly or appears in <24 hours, concerning
- **Respiratory distress:** Tachypnea >60/min, grunting, retractions, nasal flaring
- **Seizures:** In neonate, assume infection until proven (get LP, don't delay)

**Can't-Miss Diagnoses:**
1. **Bacterial Sepsis:** Group B Strep (GBS), E. coli (especially K1), other gram-negatives
2. **Meningitis:** Often presents subtly in neonates (no neck stiffness; just irritability, lethargy)
3. **Congenital Heart Disease:** Cyanosis, murmur, shock state
4. **Inborn Errors of Metabolism:** Hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, severe metabolic acidosis
5. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV):** Vesicles, CNS involvement, disseminated disease

### **Workup Algorithm:**

| Finding | Initial Assessment | Next Step |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Fever + Well-appearing** | Reassure parents, but labs mandatory | Send home only after negative 48-hour cultures (if low-risk criteria met) |
| **Fever + Ill-appearing** | Admit, empiric antibiotics, LP | Adjust antibiotics based on culture/CSF |
| **Fever + Rash** | Concern for disseminated HSV? Meningococcemia? | LP + empiric IV acyclovir + ceftriaxone |
| **Fever + GI symptoms (vomit, diarrhea)** | Often viral, BUT don't miss bacterial GI (NEC if preemie) | Work up for bacterial causes; monitor for NEC |

### **Dr. Sharma's Clinical Pearl:**
*"I admitted a seemingly well 5-day-old with mom saying 'he's just sleepy.' Turned out to be Group B Strep meningitis. Neonatal sepsis hides behind subtlety. If there's ANY concern, admit and get CSF. Missing meningitis = catastrophic."*

---

## **Session 1.2: The Vomiting Child — Age-Based Algorithm (120 minutes)**

### **Opening Case:**
> "3-day-old with bilious vomiting. 2-week-old with non-bilious projectile vomiting. 4-year-old with acute vomiting and abdominal distension. **Same symptom, three different emergencies.** What's your approach?"

### **The Critical Fork: BILIOUS vs. NON-BILIOUS**

```
VOMITING CHILD
    ↓
    Is vomit BILIOUS (yellow-green, stains clothes)?
    ├─ YES → **SURGICAL EMERGENCY**
    │       ├─ Assume malrotation/volvulus until proven
    │       ├─ NPO, NGT to suction, IV fluids (20 mL/kg bolus)
    │       ├─ STAT imaging: Abdominal X-ray, then Upper GI series (NOT CT)
    │       ├─ Surgical consultation STAT
    │       └─ Time from presentation to OR matters (>6 hours = increased necrosis risk)
    │
    └─ NO → NON-BILIOUS (Medical workup pathway)
        ├─ Age at onset?
        ├─ 2-4 weeks + projectile → Pyloric stenosis (infant)
        ├─ Acute onset, viral prodrome → Likely viral gastroenteritis
        ├─ Newborn immediately → Overfeeding, GI dysfunction, anatomic issue
        └─ Older child, high fever → Appendicitis? Other surgical abdomen?
```

### **Age-Specific Presentations:**

#### **Neonate (0-4 weeks)**

**Pyloric Stenosis:**
- Age: 2-8 weeks (peak 3-5 weeks)
- Presentation: Non-bilious, projectile vomiting after feeding, hungry immediately after
- Exam: **Visible peristaltic wave**, palpable "olive" in epigastrium (right upper quadrant)
- Labs: **Hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis** (vomiting HCl + loss of chloride)
- **CRITICAL BEFORE SURGERY:** Correct electrolytes! If K+ low, post-op apnea risk
- Diagnosis: **Abdominal ultrasound** (pyloric muscle >3mm, channel >14mm)
- Treatment: **Pyloromyotomy** (open or laparoscopic)

**\*\*Dr. Sharma's Teaching Moment:\*\*** "I see students order IV fluids, then rush to OR. **Stop.** Recheck electrolytes after hydration. This baby needs chloride repletion—give 3% saline if K+ very low. Rushing to OR on a kid with profound hypokalemia = post-op complications."

**Duodenal Atresia:**
- Age: First days of life
- Presentation: Bilious vomiting (always), often polyhydramnios in pregnancy history
- Associated: Down syndrome (~50% of cases)
- Imaging: **"Double bubble" sign** on abdominal X-ray (air in stomach + proximal duodenum)
- Treatment: **Duodenoduodenostomy** (surgical bypass)

**Esophageal Atresia/Tracheoesophageal Fistula (EA/TEF):**
- Age: Immediately at birth (or within hours of first feed)
- Presentation: Excessive drooling, respiratory distress with feeds, inability to pass NGT
- Associated: **VACTERL associations** (Vertebral, Anorectal, Cardiac, Tracheoesophageal, Renal, Limb)
- Imaging: **CXR with radiopaque dye** (look for coiling of tube in esophagus)
- Treatment: **Surgical repair** (often multi-stage depending on anatomy)

#### **Infant (1-12 months)**

**Most Common: Gastroenteritis (Viral)**
- Presentation: Acute onset, often with diarrhea, fever, URI prodrome
- Management: **Supportive** (ORS, continue feeding, monitor for dehydration)
- Red flags: Severe dehydration (>10% weight loss), bloody diarrhea, altered mental status

**Intussusception:**
- Age: Peak 6-36 months
- Presentation: **Colicky abdominal pain + vomiting + diarrhea ("currant jelly" stools)**
- Palpable mass: **Right upper quadrant "sausage-shaped" mass** on exam (30% palpable)
- Imaging: **Abdominal ultrasound** (gold standard; shows "target sign")
- Treatment: **Reduction** (air or hydrostatic enema—non-operative if no perforation signs)
- Risk of perforation: Monitor closely; if signs of peritonitis → surgical reduction

**\*\*Key Clinical Pearl:\*\*** "Intussusception is classic test answer, but I see it twice a year. Gastroenteritis is every week. BUT—when you see a 10-month-old with colicky pain and currant jelly stools, think intussusception and get ultrasound. Don't delay."

#### **Toddler (1-3 years)**

**Gastroenteritis (Most Common)**
- Presentation: Viral (rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus) or bacterial (Salmonella, Shigella)
- Management: Supportive care, continue feeding (PO rehydration if mild-moderate)
- Antibiotics: **NOT routine** (unless specific bacterial pathogen with systemic signs)
- Red flag: Bloody diarrhea with fever + toxic appearance → Consider antibiotics

**Appendicitis:**
- Presentation: Periumbilical pain → right lower quadrant, vomiting, fever, constipation common
- Classic exam: **McBurney's point tenderness**, Rovsing's sign, rebound tenderness
- Imaging: **Ultrasound or CT** (CT more sensitive but radiation; US if equipment available)
- Treatment: **Appendectomy** (open or laparoscopic)

**Obstructive Causes (Malrotation, Adhesions):**
- Presentation: Bilious vomiting (always escalate!), abdominal distension, failure to thrive if chronic
- History: Prior abdominal surgery? Prematurity?
- Imaging: **Upper GI series** (shows abnormal duodenal placement in malrotation)
- Treatment: **Surgical correction** (Ladd procedure for malrotation)

#### **School-Age Child (>5 years)**

**Appendicitis (Most Common Surgical Abdomen)**
- Higher suspicion here; kids can communicate pain better
- Presentation: RLQ pain, anorexia, vomiting, fever
- Imaging: **CT abdomen/pelvis** (gold standard; ultrasound reasonable first-line)
- Treatment: **Appendectomy**

**Peptic Ulcer Disease / Gastritis:**
- Presentation: Vomiting (may be coffee-ground if hemorrhagic), epigastric pain
- Etiology: H. pylori (most common worldwide; less common in developed countries), NSAIDs
- Workup: H. pylori testing (serology, urea breath test, or endoscopy if high suspicion)
- Management: PPI, H. pylori eradication if positive

**Functional Vomiting / Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS):**
- Presentation: Recurrent episodes of vomiting separated by symptom-free intervals
- Triggers: Stress, specific foods, infections
- Red flags to rule out: Weight loss, blood in vomit, morning vomiting only (suggests increased ICP)
- Management: Supportive, preventive medications (tricyclic antidepressants, propranolol)

### **Universal Vomiting Workup (When to Be Thorough):**

```
FOR ANY CHILD WITH VOMITING:
☐ History: Onset, bilious?, blood?, associated symptoms, feeding pattern, prior surgery
☐ Exam: Dehydration assessment, abdominal distension/tenderness, peristalsis, masses, hernia
☐ Labs if indicated: Electrolytes (hyponatremia from SIADH?), glucose, liver function
☐ Imaging: Usually start with abdominal X-ray; escalate based on presentation
☐ Red Flags Demanding Urgent Imaging: Bilious vomiting, severe pain, distension, prior surgery
☐ Escalation: If surgical abdomen suspected → Surgical consultation
```

### **Dr. Sharma's Hospitalist Wisdom:**

*"As a resident, I over-investigated vomiting. Now I know: **Bilious = surgical.** **Non-bilious = try supportive care first unless red flags.** This filters out unnecessary CTs and speeds diagnosis. Also, always ask about prior surgeries—adhesions are sneaky."*

---

## **Session 1.3: Fever Workup — Age Matters (90 minutes)**

### **Opening Challenge:**
> "3-month-old, temp 39°C, otherwise well. 2-year-old, temp 38°C, nonspecific complaints, no source found. 5-year-old, temp 37.8°C, cough. **Same vital sign, three different workup levels.** Why?"

### **The Age-Based Fever Algorithm**

**Key Principle:** **Fever risk stratification is age-dependent. Younger = more investigation.**

#### **Fever in Neonates (<28 days)**

```
ANY FEVER ≥38°C RECTAL
    ↓
    MANDATORY FULL EVALUATION (High risk of serious bacterial infection)
    ├─ Blood culture
    ├─ CBC with differential
    ├─ Urinalysis + urine culture (clean-catch or cath)
    ├─ Lumbar puncture (CSF culture, protein, glucose, Gram stain)
    ├─ CXR (rule out pneumonia, other respiratory pathology)
    └─ Empiric antibiotics: Ampicillin + gentamicin ± ceftaxime
    
    Admit to hospital (minimum observation)
```

**\*\*Why ampicillin for neonates?\*\*** Listeria monocytogenes is covered by ampicillin but NOT by 3rd-gen cephalosporins. This is unique to neonates and young infants—a classic exam question AND a real management issue.

#### **Fever in Infants 28-90 days (High-Risk Period)**

**Low-Risk Criteria (can consider outpatient management with close follow-up; rare):**
- Well-appearing, no focal source
- WBC 5-15 × 10³, **normal U/A**, CSF normal if done
- **BUT:** Most clinicians still admit for observation (safer)

**High-Risk / Unwell:**
- Admit, full fever workup, empiric antibiotics
- Concern for UTI, meningitis, bacteremia

#### **Fever in Infants 3-36 months (Variable Risk)**

**Well-Appearing, No Source Found:**
- **Occult bacteremia** risk: 3-5% in this age group (decreased with Hib/PCV vaccines)
- Workup consideration:
  - Consider **urine culture** (UTI common, can be only source)
  - **Blood culture** if high fever (≥39°C) + elevated WBC
  - **CXR** if respiratory signs
- Management:
  - If source found (otitis, pharyngitis): Appropriate antibiotics
  - If no source, well-appearing: **Can observe closely with follow-up** OR give empiric antibiotics (institution-dependent)
  - Admit if: ill-appearing, immunocompromised, unreliable follow-up

**\*\*Dr. Sharma's Clinical Decision:\*\*** "At Inova, we're conservative. Well-appearing 18-month-old with fever, no source, normal labs? I give empiric amoxicillin-clavulanate and see them in clinic in 24 hours. Reduces unnecessary admissions while keeping kids safe."

#### **Fever in Children >3 years (Lower Risk)**

**Well-Appearing:**
- Occult bacteremia rare
- Often viral URI
- Workup: Focused history/exam; lab only if indicated by findings
- Management: Supportive care, fever management, close follow-up

**Ill-Appearing or Focal Findings:**
- Workup based on presentation (e.g., strep throat → rapid strep + culture; pneumonia → CXR)
- Antibiotics targeted to suspected pathogen

### **Red Flags in Any Febrile Child:**

```
🚨 ALWAYS ESCALATE if:
☐ Petechial or purpuric rash (meningococcemia until proven)
☐ Altered mental status, lethargy, or poor response to stimulation
☐ Signs of shock (tachycardia, hypotension, delayed cap refill, decreased urine output)
☐ Difficulty breathing (stridor, severe cough)
☐ Seizures (febrile or afebrile)
☐ Severe headache + neck stiffness (meningitis)
☐ Age <28 days with any fever
☐ Immunocompromised child (cancer, HIV, transplant, asplenia)
```

### **Febrile Seizure (Common in 6 mo - 5 years):**

**Definition:** Seizure provoked by fever (usually 38-40°C), occurs in ~3-5% of children

**NOT febrile seizure if:**
- No fever present
- Afebrile seizure history
- Neurologic abnormality
- Prolonged seizure (>15 min)

**Workup:**
- First febrile seizure: **LP recommended** (to rule out meningitis) if age <18 months OR **signs of meningitis**
- If LP done and CSF normal: Reassurance
- Imaging (CT, MRI): Usually NOT needed unless abnormal neuro exam

**Management:**
- **Antipyretics** don't prevent recurrent febrile seizures (but make kid comfortable)
- **Prophylactic antiepileptics:** Usually NOT used (benzodiazepines reserved for high-risk cases)
- **Parental counseling:** Very good prognosis, no long-term developmental consequences
- **Follow-up:** Neurologist if recurrent (>3 episodes) or atypical features

---

## **Session 1.4: Red Flags Assessment & Escalation (60 minutes)**

### **Teaching Framework: The "Three Questions"**

Every hospitalist should ask at intake:

```
1️⃣ "Is this child in shock or respiratory distress?"
   → YES → Activate rapid response, admit to ICU, call specialists

2️⃣ "Does this child have any red flag findings?"
   → YES → Lower threshold for admission/escalation (see red flag list below)

3️⃣ "Can this child be safely managed on regular floor OR does this need ICU?"
   → Consider: Age, comorbidities, monitoring needs, treatment plan
```

### **Critical Red Flags by System:**

| System | Red Flags | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Respiratory** | Stridor, severe retractions, SpO₂ <90%, apnea, cyanosis | Airway assessment, oxygen, consider ICU |
| **Cardiovascular** | Pallor, delayed cap refill >2 sec, tachycardia out of proportion, hypotension | IV access, fluids, cardiology consult |
| **Neurologic** | Altered mental status, seizure, severe headache, nuchal rigidity, petechial rash | LP, antibiotics, imaging, ICU |
| **GI** | Bilious vomiting, severe abdominal pain, rigid abdomen, signs of peritonitis | Imaging, surgical consult, NPO |
| **Metabolic** | Severe acidosis, hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia, ammonia elevated | Labs, insulin/dextrose, specialist consult |

### **Escalation Pathways (Know Your Hospital System):**

**At Inova Hospital:**
- **RRT (Rapid Response Team):** Called for respiratory distress, altered mental status, shock
- **Pediatric Surgery Consult:** Any bilious vomiting, acute abdomen, trauma
- **PICU Admission:** Respiratory support needs, hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, post-surgical complications

---

# **WEEK 2: SYSTEM-BASED PEDIATRIC PROBLEMS**
## **"The Bread-and-Butter Pediatric Admissions"**

### **Guiding Principle:**
Students now move from "acute crisis" to "systematic evaluation." This week covers common pediatric problems organized by system, with focus on **hospitalist management** (not subspecialty depth).

---

## **Session 2.1: Respiratory System — Common Inpatient Problems (120 minutes)**

### **Case-Based Learning:**

**Case 1: 18-month-old with cough, fever, tachypnea**
> "Cough × 3 days, temp 38.5°C, RR 50. Mom says 'sounds like croup at night.' Exam: No stridor at rest, mild nasal congestion, lungs clear. CXR pending."

**Your assessment:**
- Likely **viral croup** or viral bronchitis (most common)
- CXR: Rule out bacterial pneumonia, foreign body, epiglottitis
- Management: Supportive (humidified air, dexamethasone if croup, close observation)

---

### **Common Respiratory Presentations:**

#### **Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis)**

**Etiology:** Viral, usually parainfluenza virus

**Presentation:**
- Prodrome: Upper respiratory symptoms (nasal congestion, mild fever)
- Classic: **Barky, seal-like cough** + **stridor** (especially at night)
- Age: 6 months - 3 years (peak)

**Severity Grading:**
- **Mild:** Occasional cough, no stridor at rest
- **Moderate:** Frequent cough, stridor at rest, no respiratory distress
- **Severe:** Stridor at rest + respiratory distress, hypoxia

**Management:**
- **All children:** Dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg × 1 dose, max 10mg) — reduces symptoms, duration, recurrence
- **Mild-Moderate:** Outpatient if reliable follow-up; discharge with caregiver counseling
- **Severe:** Admit, consider epinephrine (racemic or L-epinephrine), oxygen
- **Home care:** Humidified air, reassurance (very low mortality with treatment)

**\*\*Dr. Sharma's Pearl:\*\*** "Parents are scared of croup (that cough sounds awful!). I tell them: 'This is viral, we give one steroid dose, and it gets better in 3-5 days. Very treatable.' Dexamethasone is magic here."

#### **Bronchiolitis (RSV, other respiratory viruses)**

**Etiology:** Viral (RSV most common), causes inflammation of small airways

**Presentation:**
- Age: <2 years (peak 6-12 months)
- Prodrome: URI symptoms
- Progressive: Cough, tachypnea, wheezing or crackles on auscultation
- Severe: Respiratory distress, hypoxia, apnea (especially preemies, <6 weeks)

**2024-2025 Guideline Update:** **Albuterol and steroids NOT routinely recommended** (evidence doesn't support routine use)

**Management:**
- **Supportive:** Oxygen if SpO₂ <90%, nasal suctioning, hydration
- **Hospitalization indication:** Respiratory distress, SpO₂ <90%, apnea, age <6 weeks, severe comorbidities (prematurity, congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency)
- **Avoid:** Routine antibiotics (viral!), routine steroids/albuterol
- **Ribavirin:** Reserved for severely immunocompromised (rare)

**Prognosis:** Most recover in 5-7 days; some cough lingers weeks

**\*\*Key Teaching:\*\*** "I see students reflexively giving albuterol to bronchiolitis. Stop. We don't do that anymore. Supportive care—oxygen, monitoring, hydration—is the mainstay. Antibiotics only if bacterial superinfection suspected (fever recurrence, focal findings)."

#### **Pneumonia**

**Etiology (Age-Dependent):**
- **<5 years:** Viral (RSV, influenza, parainfluenza) most common; bacterial (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae) less common
- **School-age:** Bacterial (S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, atypicals) more common

**Presentation:**
- Fever, cough (often productive in older kids), tachypnea, chest pain (if pleurisy), dyspnea
- Exam: Crackles/rales on auscultation (especially lower lobes), possible consolidation signs

**Diagnosis:**
- **CXR:** Shows infiltrate (lobar, multilobar, or bronchopneumonia pattern)
- Labs: CBC (elevated WBC if bacterial), blood culture (if admitted)
- **Viral testing:** Rapid tests for RSV, influenza, COVID-19

**Management (Viral vs. Bacterial):**

| Presentation | Likely Etiology | Antibiotic? |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Fever, URI symptoms, viral study positive | Viral pneumonia | NO (supportive only) |
| High fever, lobar infiltrate, elevated WBC, toxic appearance | Likely bacterial | YES (amoxicillin PO or ceftriaxone IV) |
| Cough 2+ weeks, negative exam but constitutional symptoms | M. pneumoniae (atypical) | YES (azithromycin) |

**Admission Criteria:**
- Respiratory distress
- SpO₂ <90%
- Age <6 months
- Severe comorbidities
- Inability to take oral antibiotics
- Immunocompromised

---

#### **Reactive Airway Disease (RAD) / Asthma**

**Presentation:**
- Wheezing (expiratory primarily, but can be biphasic if severe)
- Cough (often worse at night, with play, or URI-triggered)
- Dyspnea, air hunger

**Severity Grading (For Treatment):**

| Mild Intermittent | Mild Persistent | Moderate Persistent | Severe Persistent |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Symptoms <2x/week | Symptoms 2-6 days/week | Daily symptoms | Symptoms throughout day |
| Normal FEV₁ between exacerbations | Slight lung function ↓ | Moderate lung function ↓ | Severe lung function ↓ |
| No nighttime symptoms | 1-2 nights/month | 3-4 nights/month | ≥5 nights/week |

**Acute Exacerbation Management:**

```
MILD-MODERATE EXACERBATION:
├─ Albuterol nebulizer: 0.15 mg/kg (max 5 mg) every 20 min × 3 doses
├─ Systemic steroids: Prednisone/prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg (max 60 mg)
├─ ICS (inhaled corticosteroid) if not already on one
└─ Reassess: If improved, consider discharge with close follow-up

SEVERE EXACERBATION (Status Asthmaticus):
├─ Admit to hospital / ICU
├─ Continuous albuterol nebulization (not just intermittent)
├─ IV magnesium sulfate (50 mg/kg over 20 min, max 2 g)
├─ IV steroids: Methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone
├─ Oxygen to maintain SpO₂ >90%
├─ Consider epinephrine (SC or IV) if no response
└─ Monitor for impending respiratory failure (tiring, altered mental status)
```

**\*\*Red Flags for ICU Admission:**
- Severe accessory muscle use, cannot speak full sentences
- Peak flow <40% predicted
- SpO₂ <90% despite oxygen
- Altered mental status (exhaustion, CO₂ retention)

---

### **Hospitalist Summary: Respiratory System**

**The Key Decisions:**
1. **Viral vs. Bacterial?** → Impacts antibiotic decision
2. **Hypoxia present?** → Oxygen need
3. **Respiratory distress?** → Admit vs. discharge
4. **Can kid tolerate PO?** → Oral vs. IV antibiotics
5. **Disposition:** Home with precautions, floor admission, or ICU?

---

## **Session 2.2: Gastrointestinal System — Inpatient Focus (120 minutes)**

### **The GI Presentations You'll See:**

**High-Frequency Admissions:**
1. **Gastroenteritis (Viral)** — Most common GI admission
2. **Failure to Thrive / Malnutrition** — Chronic but requires hospitalization
3. **Celiac Disease (New Diagnosis)** — Can present acutely
4. **Appendicitis** — Surgical emergency
5. **Constipation (Severe)** — Functional, but blocks GI

**Less Frequent but Important:**
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) — flares, complications
- Food Allergies / CMPA — severe reactions
- Intussusception — pediatric surgical emergency (covered in Week 1)

---

### **Viral Gastroenteritis (The Most Common)**

**Etiology:** Rotavirus (less common post-vaccine), norovirus, adenovirus, astrovirus

**Presentation:**
- Acute onset diarrhea, vomiting, fever
- Usually 1-7 days duration
- Abdominal cramping common

**Management (2024-2025 Evidence):**

```
VIRAL GASTROENTERITIS MANAGEMENT:
├─ **Continue feeding** (no prolonged NPO; increases malnutrition risk)
├─ **Oral rehydration solution (ORS):** 50-100 mL/kg over 4 hours for mild-moderate dehydration
│   ├─ Small, frequent sips (5 mL q10min)
│   ├─ Consider NG tube if unable to PO
│   └─ Goal: Replace deficit + ongoing losses
├─ **Lactose-free formula** if on formula (temporary)
├─ **Avoid:** High-sugar drinks (apple juice, sports drinks)
├─ **Probiotics:** Modest evidence for Lactobacillus GG (may shorten duration 1-2 days)
├─ **Zinc supplementation:** In developing countries (limited data in developed countries)
└─ **Antibiotics:** NO (viral; no benefit; may harm gut flora)

ADMISSION CRITERIA:
☐ Severe dehydration (≥10% weight loss, shock)
☐ Unable to take PO (severe vomiting despite antiemetics)
☐ Bloody diarrhea (rare but concerning)
☐ Age <6 months (higher risk of complications)
☐ Immunocompromised
☐ Unreliable follow-up
```

**Dehydration Assessment:**

| Mild (3-5%) | Moderate (6-9%) | Severe (≥10%) |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Normal thirst, normal cap refill | Increased thirst, normal cap refill | Extreme thirst, delayed cap refill |
| Normal urine output | ↓ urine output | ↓↓ urine output |
| Normal mental status | Alert but irritable | Altered mental status, lethargy |
| No labs needed; watch | Monitor intake/output | Admit, IV fluids, labs |

**\*\*Dr. Sharma's Hospitalist Approach:\*\*** "I see too many admissions for 'dehydration from viral gastroenteritis.' Most can be managed at home with ORS if we educate parents well. I admit if truly unable to tolerate PO despite our efforts, or if signs of severe dehydration. This reduces unnecessary admits and lets bed space go to sicker kids."

---

### **Failure to Thrive (FTT) / Malnutrition**

**Definition:** Weight <3rd percentile for age OR crossing growth percentile lines downward

**Etiology (GI-Focused):**
- **Medical causes:** Celiac disease, IBD, CF, food allergy, reflux, chronic diarrhea
- **Nutritional causes:** Inadequate caloric intake, poor formula preparation
- **Feeding issues:** Oral motor dysfunction, behavioral (picky eater)
- **Multifactorial:** Usually combination of medical + environmental

**Red Flags for Organic GI Disease:**
- FTT onset <6 months (earlier = more likely organic)
- Vomiting with feeds, diarrhea (bloody? oily?)
- Abdominal distension or pain
- Family history of celiac, IBD, CF

**Initial Hospitalist Workup:**

```
STEP 1: Assess Severity
├─ Calculate % weight loss from baseline
├─ Assess muscle mass, subcutaneous fat (malnutrition severity)
└─ Signs of deficiency: Hair changes? Skin findings? Edema (kwashiorkor)?

STEP 2: Directed History & Exam
├─ Feeding history (formula prep? Exclusive breastfed?)
├─ Stool pattern (consistency, frequency, blood, fat)
├─ Vomiting pattern, timing relative to feeds
├─ Exam: Abdominal masses? Organomegaly? Perianal disease?
└─ Developmental assessment (global delay vs. isolated growth issue?)

STEP 3: Labs (If Organic Etiology Suspected)
├─ CBC (anemia? MCV—iron deficiency vs. macrocytic from B12/folate)
├─ CMP, albumin (protein malnutrition)
├─ Tissue transglutaminase (celiac screening if indicated)
├─ Fecal fat (72-hour collection if steatorrhea suspected—malabsorption)
└─ Consider: CF sweat test, cow's milk protein allergy trial

STEP 4: Nutritional Repletion
├─ Caloric needs: Calculated based on weight + age
├─ Increase caloric density (add fat, not just calories)
├─ Consider high-calorie supplements (Pediasure, etc.) if inadequate PO
├─ If severe malnutrition + inadequate PO → Consider feeding tube
└─ Monitor: Weekly weights, growth trajectory
```

**Admission Indications for FTT:**
- Severe malnutrition requiring supervised refeeding
- Medical complication (dehydration, electrolyte abnormality)
- Suspected abuse/neglect
- Inability to feed at home
- Need for diagnostic procedures (endoscopy for celiac, swallow study)

---

### **Celiac Disease (New Diagnosis)**

**2024-2025 Update:** Diagnosis can be made **without biopsy** if serology strongly positive.

**Presentation (Variable):**
- GI: Chronic diarrhea ("veggie stools"), abdominal distension, constipation paradoxically
- Systemic: Failure to thrive, fatigue, irritability
- Subtle: May present with just iron deficiency anemia or normal growth with vague symptoms

**Diagnostic Workup:**
1. **Serology first (on regular diet with gluten):**
   - Tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) [MOST SENSITIVE]
   - Total IgA (rule out IgA deficiency)
   - Endomysial antibody (EMA-IgA) for confirmation

2. **Interpretation:**
   - **tTG-IgA ≥10x upper limit of normal + EMA positive → Diagnosis made (no biopsy needed)**
   - **Intermediate values OR IgA deficiency → Need biopsy**

3. **Biopsy (if needed):**
   - Endoscopy with distal duodenal biopsy
   - Shows villous atrophy (Marsh grade 3)
   - Multiple sites important (patchy involvement)

**Management:**
- **Gluten-free diet (STRICT adherence)** — ONLY effective treatment
- Screen for micronutrient deficiency: Iron, B12, folate, fat-soluble vitamins, calcium
- Repeat serology 1-2 years (should normalize if compliant)
- Monitor for complications: Osteoporosis risk, dermatitis herpetiformis, other autoimmune conditions
- Dietitian referral ESSENTIAL

**Hospitalist Role:**
- Make diagnosis
- Referral to dietitian for education
- Support in transition to gluten-free lifestyle
- Address nutritional deficiencies before discharge

## **Session 2.3: Cardiac & Neurologic Red Flags (90 minutes)**

### **Cardiac Emergencies You Must Recognize:**

#### **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) in Children**

**Common Etiology:**
- **Structural:** Ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
- **Cardiomyopathy:** Myocarditis (viral), dilated cardiomyopathy (genetic)
- **Arrhythmia:** SVT, complete heart block

**Presentation:**
- **Infants:** Poor feeding, failure to thrive, respiratory distress, hepatomegaly
- **Older kids:** Dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, ascites

**Exam Findings:**
- Tachycardia, tachypnea
- Cardiomegaly on CXR (heart size >50% of chest diameter)
- Rales on lung exam (pulmonary edema)
- Hepatomegaly (right heart strain)
- Gallop rhythm (S3)

**Workup:**
- **CXR:** Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema (Kerley B lines)
- **ECG:** May show chamber enlargement, ischemia
- **Echocardiography:** Definitive; shows chamber function, ejection fraction, structural disease

**Management:**
- **Diuretics:** Furosemide for volume overload
- **ACE inhibitors:** Reduce afterload
- **Beta-blockers:** Improve function
- **Treatment of underlying cause:** Surgical correction of structural lesions, antivirals for myocarditis
- Specialist (Cardiology) consultation ESSENTIAL

#### **Arrhythmias**

**Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) - Most Common Pediatric Arrhythmia**

**Presentation:**
- Infants: Irritability, poor feeding, shock if prolonged
- Older kids: Palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, syncope

**ECG Finding:** Regular, narrow-complex tachycardia, no P waves visible (buried in T wave)

**Acute Management:**
1. **Vagal maneuvers** (older child): Valsalva, ice water immersion (infants)
2. **Adenosine IV:** 0.1 mg/kg rapid push (works by blocking AV node)
   - If unsuccessful: 0.2 mg/kg push
   - Goal: Brief AV node block → SVT terminates, sinus rhythm returns
3. **Synchronized cardioversion:** If hemodynamically unstable or adenosine fails

**Follow-up:**
- **Holter monitor / event monitor:** Detect recurrences
- **Cardiology referral:** Consider ablation if recurrent

---

### **Neurologic Red Flags:**

#### **Seizures**

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- **Febrile seizure** (most common, 6mo-5yr with fever)
- **Generalized tonic-clonic seizure** (epilepsy, metabolic, infection)
- **Absence seizure** (brief staring, no memory; often multiple per day)
- **Complex partial seizure** (behavioral arrest, lip smacking, post-ictal confusion)
- **Status epilepticus** (seizure >5 minutes or repeated seizures without return to baseline) — EMERGENCY

**Initial Assessment:**
```
SEIZING CHILD
├─ Position: Turn on side (prevent aspiration)
├─ Airway: Ensure patent, give oxygen
├─ IV access: Draw labs (glucose, electrolytes, CBC, culture if fever)
├─ Check glucose stat: Hypoglycemia easy to treat
├─ Fever? → Full septic workup (bacterial meningitis risk)
├─ Rash? → Meningococcal concern, empiric antibiotics
└─ Imaging (CT/MRI): If abnormal neuro exam or status epilepticus
```

**Anticonvulsant Choices:**
- **First-line:** Levetiracetam (Keppra), lacosamide
- **Status epilepticus:** Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV, then fosphenytoin (Cerebyx) or levetiracetam

**Admission Indications:**
- First unprovoked seizure
- Status epilepticus
- Abnormal neuro exam
- Suspected infection (meningitis, encephalitis)

#### **Meningitis (Bacterial)**

**Presentation:**
- Infants: Fever, irritability, lethargy, poor feeding (classic triad of fever + meningismus + altered mental status ABSENT in infants)
- Older kids: Fever, headache, neck stiffness, altered mental status, possible rash (petechiae/purpura)

**Red Flag:** Petechial rash with fever = meningococcemia until proven otherwise

**Diagnosis:**
- **Lumbar puncture (LP):** Gold standard
  - CSF findings: Elevated protein, low glucose, pleocytosis (PMNs)
  - Culture: Grows organism
  - Gram stain: May show organism

**\*\*CRITICAL:\*\*** If meningitis suspected + LP delayed → Give antibiotics immediately (don't wait for LP)

**Empiric Antibiotics (Based on Age):**
- **<3 months:** Ampicillin + gentamicin + ceftazidime (covers Listeria)
- **3 months - 18 years:** Ceftriaxone + vancomycin + (add ampicillin if <50 years OLD or immunocompromised for Listeria)
- **Dexamethasone:** 0.15 mg/kg IV (reduces mortality if given with or before first antibiotic dose)

**Prognosis:** Mortality ~10-15%; long-term disability (hearing loss, developmental delay) in survivors

# **WEEK 3: CHRONIC & COMPLEX PEDIATRIC CONDITIONS**
## **"The Long-Term Management & Discharge Planning"**

### **Principle:**
By Week 3, students understand acute presentations. Now focus on **continuity:** How do we manage chronic disease in hospital? When do we discharge? What needs to happen before going home?

---

## **Session 3.1: Chronic Conditions Requiring Hospitalization (120 minutes)**

### **Pediatric Asthma Exacerbation — Hospitalization & Management**

**Admission Criteria (Moderate-Severe Exacerbation):**
- Peak flow 40-69% predicted
- Moderate-severe dyspnea, speak in phrases
- Respiratory rate elevated for age
- SpO₂ 90-94% on room air
- Failure to respond to ER treatment

**Inpatient Management Protocol:**

```
HOSPITAL DAY 1-2: ACUTE PHASE
├─ Continuous pulse oximetry
├─ Albuterol: Nebulized continuously (not just q 4h)
├─ Ipratropium (anticholinergic): Enhances beta-2 agonist effect
├─ IV/oral steroids: Prednisone 1-2 mg/kg daily (usually 3-5 days total)
├─ IV magnesium: 50 mg/kg (max 2g) if not responding
├─ Oxygen: Target SpO₂ >90%
└─ CXR if concerned for pneumothorax or pneumonia

REASSESSMENT (q 4-6 hours):
├─ Peak flow (trend important)
├─ Subjective: "Can you talk in full sentences?"
├─ Objective: RR, retractions, accessory muscle use
└─ Disposition: If improving → Step down to intermittent neb

DISCHARGE CRITERIA (Usually Day 2-3):
☐ Peak flow >70% predicted
☐ SpO₂ >90% on room air
☐ No accessory muscle use at rest
☐ Tolerating PO without distress
☐ Reliable discharge plan in place
```

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) daily (the key for preventing recurrence)
- Beta-2 agonist PRN for symptoms
- Spacer technique review (many kids use incorrectly)
- Asthma action plan (green/yellow/red zones)
- Trigger identification
- Follow-up with PCP/Pulmonology in 1-2 weeks

---

### **Dehydration from Chronic Diarrhea — Multifactorial Management**

**Common Etiologies Requiring Hospitalization:**
- Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis) — flare
- Celiac disease — new diagnosis with severe symptoms
- Short bowel syndrome (post-surgical)
- Malabsorption (cystic fibrosis, tropical sprue)

**Hospitalization Goals:**
1. **Rehydrate** with IV fluids (replace deficit + ongoing losses)
2. **Identify/treat underlying cause** (endoscopy for IBD? Biopsy for celiac?)
3. **Nutritional repletion** (high-calorie diet once tolerating PO)
4. **Medication initiation** (if IBD → start appropriate therapy)

**IV Rehydration Protocol:**
- **Bolus:** 20 mL/kg normal saline over 1 hour (reassess perfusion)
- **Maintenance + ongoing losses:** Calculated based on urine output, stool losses
- **Electrolyte repletion:** Based on labs (hyponatremia, hypokalemia common)

**Dietary Management (Once Tolerating PO):**
- Clear liquids → Regular diet (advance as tolerated)
- High-calorie (add fats), lactose-free if appropriate
- Small, frequent meals
- Probiotics: Controversial; some evidence for Lactobacillus GG

---

## **Session 3.2: Complex Discharge Planning (90 minutes)**

### **The Discharge Huddle: What Students Need to Know**

**Before Discharge, Ensure:**

```
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT:
☐ Acute issue resolved (fever down, hydration restored, pain controlled)
☐ Chronic medications prescribed (written list)
☐ Follow-up appointments scheduled (specialist, PCP)
☐ Prescriptions filled? Insurance approved?
☐ Device training done (inhaler, feeding tube, etc.)

SOCIAL / SAFETY:
☐ Caregiver understands diagnosis & treatment plan
☐ Return precautions given (written + verbal)
☐ Food insecurity assessed? Refer social work if needed
☐ Unsafe home environment flagged? CPS consultation if needed
☐ Ability to give medications at home confirmed

COMMUNICATION:
☐ Discharge summary written (clear for PCP)
☐ School notification if needed (seizure action plan, asthma action plan)
☐ Specialist communication (if referred, does specialist have info?)
☐ Follow-up calls made? (Day 2-3 post-discharge check-in)
```

### **Red Flags for Delaying Discharge:**

- Pending test results that will change management
- Caregiver unable to demonstrate competency (e.g., insulin injection)
- Unsafe discharge environment (homelessness, abuse)
- Inability to afford medications/follow-up
- Complication developing (e.g., infection post-op)

# **WEEK 4: SYNTHESIS & SENIOR-LEVEL PRESENTATIONS**

### **Session 4.1: Case Presentations — Applying the Month's Learning (90 minutes)**

**Format:**
Students present real cases admitted during their rotation (with de-identification).

**Presentation Structure (7 minutes):**
1. **Chief Complaint & HPI** (2 min)
2. **Assessment: What was your differential & why?** (2 min)
3. **Workup: What did you order & why?** (1 min)
4. **Management: What changed your management?** (1 min)
5. **Learning: What would you do differently next time?** (1 min)

**Dr. Sharma's Teaching During Presentation:**
- "Good—you recognized this was bilious. Next time, how fast can you escalate to surgery?"
- "You ordered a CT. Was that the best first test? What about ultrasound?"
- "This child had celiac—what screening test would have caught this earlier?"

**Group Discussion:**
- Peers ask clarifying questions
- Faculty highlight decision points
- Evidence-based recommendations shared

---

### **Session 4.2: Quality Improvement Project Introduction (60 minutes)**

**Possible QI Projects for Pediatric Hospitalists:**

1. **"Reducing Unnecessary Imaging in Viral Gastroenteritis"**
   - Current state: Many kids getting abdominal imaging despite clear viral gastroenteritis
   - Goal: Implement decision rule (no imaging if clear history, normal exam)
   - Measure: % reduction in imaging orders

2. **"Improving Asthma Action Plan Documentation"**
   - Current state: Discharged asthma patients don't have written action plan
   - Goal: 100% of discharged asthmatic kids receive written plan
   - Measure: Compliance rate, 30-day readmission rate

3. **"Standardizing Celiac Serology Screening"**
   - Current state: Inconsistent screening in at-risk kids
   - Goal: Screening algorithm implemented in EHR
   - Measure: % of high-risk kids screened

**Dr. Sharma's Guidance:**
"Pick something YOU see repeatedly. Fix it. Measure it. That's how you improve pediatric care. Small changes multiply across a hospital."

## **DR. SHIKSHA SHARMA'S FINAL TEACHING MOMENTS**

### **On Diagnostic Decision-Making:**
*"The most dangerous word in medicine is 'typical.' You think 'oh, that's just viral gastroenteritis' and miss the appendicitis. Don't anchor on first impression. Always ask: 'What could hurt this kid? What have I ruled out?'"*

### **On Communication:**
*"Your job as a hospitalist is to be translator—between parents who are scared, specialists who speak jargon, and medical students learning the ropes. Be clear, be kind, be certain in your knowledge."*

### **On Continuous Learning:**
*"I finished fellowship last year. I didn't know half of what I know now. Stay curious. Ask why. Read. Reflect on cases that didn't go as expected. That's how you become a great hospitalist."*
